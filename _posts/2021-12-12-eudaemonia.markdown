<b><i>Eudaemonia</i></b>  [<a href="https://github.com/glnnrhodes/Eudaemonia">Repo</a>] seeks to motivate and engage users to improve their mental and physical health by providing a social platform to share health and wellness activities, as well as gamify the experience to encourage sustained growth.

    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">A focus of Eudaemonia is to provide a platform that incentivizes personal health and wellness. The first step that Eudaemonia takes to provide this platform is allowing users to log both physical and mental health activities. Once a user begins logging one of the dozens of included activities, the application will take care of all the data collection pertinent to the event being recorded. By allowing users to log and track their habits of mental and physical health, Eudaemonia enables the ability to grow and feel rewarded for catering to their own health and wellness.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">To further enable its users to track their progress, Eudaemonia prepares statistics pages broken down by activity type. You can find tons of information here, from points earned and spent, to broken down details of individual activity types. In the images here you can see some of the information that is available to our users.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Another focus of Eudaemonia is to promote social wellness. Our goal was to create a feature that allows users to gain additional support and motivation from other users. Friends feature - Users able to form connections with other users through friend requests. Once you are friends with another user, you will be able to view their recorded activities. Much like other social media platforms where you'll be able to see how your friends are doing. Groups feature - Users are able to form their own groups or join existing groups. Once a user is in a group, theyâ€™ll be able to earn additional points from group activities. This functionality was implemented to promote social interaction and motivation of our users.</p>
